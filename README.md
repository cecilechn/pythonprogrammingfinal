# Python Programming Final

Context: This project was the final assignment of the course “Python Programming” from the MSc in Data Analytics and AI at EDHEC Business School in 2022-2023.
It was done in collaboration with 3 classmates. I focused on the cleaning data and Product insight discovery part.

Dataset: “sales_data” (uploaded in the repo)

Goal:
- explore the data (international sales)
- clean the data
- find interesting insights to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the company so that the Sales department can develop targeted commercial strategies to the appropriate country and product categories.
